### Setup (macOS)

Assuming you have node, npm, php and composer installed, you will need to install the following packages using homebrew commands:
```blade
brew install grpc
brew install protobuf
brew install protoc
```

Run the following command from root of project

```blade
protoc -I proto --php_out=lib --grpc_out=lib --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=`which grpc_php_plugin` ./protos/jokes.proto --proto_path=./protos
```

This will auto generate files needed for the grpc service / client based on what has been specified within the `protos/jokes.proto` file

Run `composer install`. This will add the php libs we need to run the example and look after auto-loading of php files generated by the `protoc` command above.
